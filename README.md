## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Shon. I work as a DevOps engineer and cloud solutions architect, mostly on AWS. I build and run infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and containerized applications in a way that scales and stays reliable.

Some of the tools I work with regularly: Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, GitHub Actions, Prometheus, Grafana.  

Certifications I have: AWS Solutions Architect Associate, Certified Kubernetes Administrator, Terraform Associate.

Featured projects:
- terraform-aws-three-tier-app: a production-ready 3-tier web app setup with VPC, ALB, and RDS using Terraform modules.
- k8s-observability-stack: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki stack deployment on Kubernetes with basic alerting.
- ci-cd-pipeline-demo: a full GitHub Actions pipeline from build to deploy on EKS.

I try to make infrastructure predictable, observable, and easy to maintain. Most of my previous work is private, but these projects show how I approach design, automation, and reliability.
