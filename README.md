## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Shon. I build and run cloud infrastructure, mostly on AWS, and I really like making things work reliably and at scale.  

I've been doing DevOps for a few years now â€” setting up CI/CD pipelines, managing Kubernetes clusters, writing Terraform modules, and generally keeping systems running smoothly.  

Some things Iâ€™ve worked on (all examples I can share publicly):  
- **terraform-aws-three-tier-app** â€” a full 3-tier architecture on AWS built with Terraform.  
- **k8s-observability-stack** â€” Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki for monitoring Kubernetes workloads.  
- **ci-cd-pipeline-demo** â€” a GitHub Actions pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys a containerized app to EKS.  

Certifications I hold: AWS Solutions Architect, CKA, Terraform Associate.  

I try to keep my repos clear and documented so anyone can follow how I approach infrastructure and automation.
