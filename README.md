Hi, I'm Shon. I'm a DevOps engineer and cloud solutions architect with experience building and running infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and containerized applications that scale and stay reliable.

Some of the tools I work with regularly: Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, GitHub Actions, Prometheus, Grafana.

Certifications: AWS Solutions Architect Associate, Certified Kubernetes Administrator, Terraform Associate.

Featured projects:
- terraform-aws-three-tier-app: a production-ready 3-tier web app setup with VPC, ALB, and RDS using Terraform modules.
- k8s-observability-stack: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki stack deployment on Kubernetes with basic alerting.
- ci-cd-pipeline-demo: a full GitHub Actions pipeline from build to deploy on EKS.

Iâ€™m currently looking for new DevOps opportunities. These projects showcase how I approach design, automation, and reliability.
